# PassBy (iOS 9 through 13)

This is a highly customizable iOS Tweak that lets you avoid being asked for passcode when certain conditions are verified.

These safe conditons are determined by the device's connectivity, and include a customizable timeout after which, even if the condition is still true, you will be asked for the passcode/biometrics again.

## Unlock Options

Auto-unlock can be enabled under these conditions:

- Within a timeframe since last time the device was locked
- Connected to specific WiFi networks
- Connected to specific Bluetooth devices
- Connected to Apple Watch
- Wired Headphones plugged in
- Triggered by Activator Event

It can be chosen whether to enable the bypass upon connection or after the first normal unlock in presence of the condition.

The tweak also allows to automatically dismiss the LockScreen CoverSheet when no notification or media controls are showing.

## Security

The main concern people have with this tweak is whether it lowers the device's security, however that depends on the configuration.
The tweak employs AES128 to store both the device passcode and the WiFi networks/BT devices names.

The tweak will also warn users when they try to add an unprotected network to the whitelist:
if an attacker were to set up an open network with an identical name, your phone will connect to it, 
thus unlocking itself (if set to do so upon connection).
This is no longer a real risk, as iOS will send Probe Requests for hidden networks only,
